    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Pacaline Irabaruta, I was born in Rwanda.<br>
      I grew up loving to explore and create things on my own and that is how<br>
      I came in the field of Information Technology(IT).<br>
      <br>
      I studied my primary school at Ste Marie auxiliatrice and continued in <br>
      high school at Lycee De Kigali where I studied Math,Physics and Computer science.<br>
      and now I am a student at Adventist University of Central Africa(AUCA).<br>
      <br>
      I decided to take an interesting class of programming which am currently in<br>
       because I wanted to learn new things and improve myself in the field of <br>
       Technology so that I can improve others as well and use Technology to solve<br>
       different tasks.<br>
       <br>
       My current interests and hobbies include:
       <ol>
         <li>exploring new things</li>
         <li>coding</li>
         <li>working to solve tasks</li>
         <li>working to solve tasks</li>
         <li>reading books</li>
       </ol>
